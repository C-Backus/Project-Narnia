Able to create a web UI using the Flask package in Python. This is scalable for remote access.

Python v3.10

pip install flask	<- web ui

pip install gunicorn	<- for scalability

pip install paramiko	<- for connecting to Linux server remotely using SSH/SFTP

Currently SSH'ing into my WSL on local network. Will work core functionality here until NAS hardware stood up.
