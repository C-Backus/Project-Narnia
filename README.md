# Project Narnia
CS3300 Semester Project

We are seeking to allow people to access their own large data storage device via same, in-home, network access, with a stretch goal of outside-of-network access. This is similar in scope of Google Drive; however, the user would retain all ownership of the data storage device and be able to change the size of storage as they see fit, without having to “rent” cloud storage. Additionally, there is no risk of a third party organization abusing their private and/or sensitive data.
