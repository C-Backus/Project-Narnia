# Network Accessible Storage System
CS3300 Semester Project

We are seeking to allow people to access their own large data storage device via same, in-home, network access, with a stretch goal of outside-of-network access. This is similar in scope of Google Drive; however, the user would retain all ownership of the data storage device and be able to change the size of storage as they see fit, without having to “rent” cloud storage. Additionally, there is no risk of a third party organization abusing their private and/or sensitive data.

This was done by utilizing free and open-source software. 

Free and open-source: Ubuntu, Conda, Python pacakages

Free: VS Code

Due to the nature of the system as whole, it is up to the end-user to supply their own server hardware and access machines. There are no baseline specifications to run this software, however, it is reccomended that the server hardware be SSD storage devices and include a minimum 8 GB of RAM, and the access machines should be robust enough to execute moderate intensity programs.
