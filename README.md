# Network Accessible Storage System
CS3300 Semester Project

This software system is a tool intended to be used by those who are data privacy-aware. It provides a system level implementation of a a network accessible storage device and allows access to a large data storage device via same network access. While at face value, this may seem similar to various cloud server service provided by big name companies, there are some key distinctions: the user retains all ownership of the data storage device without having to rent cloud storage and retains control of the software itself. Additionally, there is no risk of a third party organization abusing their private and/or sensitive data. This was done by utilizing free and open-source software. 

Free and open-source: Ubuntu, Conda, Python pacakages

Free: VS Code

## Requirements
Due to the nature of the system as whole, it is up to the end-user to supply their own server hardware and access machines. There are no baseline specifications to run this software, however, it is reccomended that the server hardware be SSD storage devices and include a minimum 8 GB of RAM, and the access machines should be robust enough to execute moderate intensity programs.
